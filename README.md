Using Python and some basic machine learning techniques, I've developed a prototype recommendation system that suggests personalized movie or TV show recommendations based on users' viewing history and preferences.

While it's still in its early stages and considered a basic implementation, I'm thrilled with the progress and potential of this project. The system employs collaborative filtering methods to analyze user interactions and make recommendations, aiming to enhance the overall viewing experience for users.
